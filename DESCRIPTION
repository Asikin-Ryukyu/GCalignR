Description: Aligns chromatography peaks with a three step algorithm: (1) Linear
    transformation of retention times to maximise shared peaks among samples
    (2) Align peaks within a certain error-interval (3) Merges rows that are likely
    representing the same substance (i.e. no sample shows peaks in both rows and
    the rows have similar retention time means).
