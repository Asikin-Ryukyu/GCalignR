## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have implemented the following changes:

1. The documentation of the package was significantly enhanced and a new vignette was added.
2. More efficient coding allowed to reduce the computation time of several functions.
3. Progress bars have been implemented to estimate run times of the algorithm.
4. The functionality is enhanced by adding several new functions to the package.
5. A CITATION file was added to link the package to our manuscript that is currently under revision.
