## Intro

Metabolomics approaches such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) are increasingly used
by biologists to unravel the chemical basis of animal olfactory communication (citations). For the detection
of broader patterns in chemical samples most researchers use an untargeted approach and
analyse the whole spectrum of chemicals rather than targeting specific compounds. However, 
chromatography data across multiple samples are not directly comparable as the retention times of peaks
vary across samples due to subtle, random and often unavoidable variation of the GC-MS machine parameters [@pierce2005classification]. For studies interested in chemical patterns across samples it therefore 
becomes essential to account for these retention time drifts by using an appropriate alignment method.

Despite the existence of automated alignment algorithms [e.g. @smith2006xcms; @stein1999integrated; @robinson2007dynamic], most researchers in the relatively young fields of mammalian and avian chemical communication align chromatograms manually
[@charpentier2008smelling; @setchell2010odour; @caspers2011scents; @leclaire2012semiochemical; @theis2013symbiotic] or identify all compounds prior to analysis [@whittaker2010songbird] rather than using automated alignment software. Depending on the
sample size and the number of compounds present in the samples, manual alignment can take up to several weaks and
might be biased due to subjective expectations of the researcher. 

`GCalignR` provides a simple means of aligning peaks from gas chromatography data based
on retention times. It has been developed in R and the results can easily be used as input
for further statistical packages such as `vegan`. We specifically developed and tested `GCalignR` 
as a preprocessing tool prior to the statistical analysis of chemical samples from animal skin and preen glands [see @stoffel2015chemical for an application of the underlying algorithm]. 


## Installation

The development version can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/mastoffel/GCalignR) with
the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
install.packages("devtools") devtools::install_github("mastoffel/GCalignR",
build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```

The package provides a comprehensive documentation, check out the `GCalignR` help file.

```{r} 
library("GCalignR") 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
?GCalignR 
```

## GCalignR contains the following functions:

* `align_chromatograms`: Aligns gas-chromatography peak data by retention times. 
* `gc_heatmap`: Plots the results (and intermediate steps) of the alignment. With a heatmap, the user can visually
inspect the quality of the alignment and if necessary adjust the parameters accordingly.
* `check_input`: Checks the format of the input data for conformity with the requirements and highlights violations.
* `plot.GCalign`: Plots the distribution of Peaks after the alignment and shows density histograms of applied linear
transformations and retention time ranges (i.e. difference between minimum and maximum retention time per substance).
* `print.GCalign`: Summarises the alignment procedure (e.g. documents all arguments to the function call).
* `norm_peaks`: Normalises the abundance measure of peaks and returns and data frame of peak concentrations for all samples that is ready to use for analysis tools such as [LINK to vegan´s nmds functions]


## The alignment algorithm

The alignment algorithm implemented in the `align_chromatograms` function follows the following steps:

1. One sample provides the reference peak list, which is used to align all other peak lists
by means of shifting them to maximise shared peaks with the reference. This step corrects systematic
shifts in the retention times of chromatograms. The maximum shift can be specified with the
`max_linear_shift` argument.

2. This step corrects unreliability of individual peak retention times and essentially 
tries to minimise variation within a retention time row. The maximum shift per peak can be specified with the
`max_diff_peak2mean` argument.

3. In a third step, retention time rows are merged if they have similar retention time means and non
of the samples shows peaks in both or the rows (with the assumption that these two rows represent a
single substance). The maximum mean difference between two retention time rows can be specified with the
`min_diff_peak2peak` argument.

### Optional steps:

4. Delete peaks that occur in just one sample by setting the `delete_single_peak` argument to `TRUE`

5. Delete all peaks that occur in control samples or blanks by specifying the IDs of the blank
   samples 


## Input data

The statistical analysis of GC or GC-MS data is usually based on the detection of signal peaks within
the chromatograms, which is can be done by proprietary software or free programs such as AMDIS [@stein1999integrated].
The peak data of a chromatogramm usually contain the retention time of a given peak plus additional information such 
as the area under the peak or its height which are used in the subsequent analysis. 
`GCalignR` uses the retention times (and not the mass-spectra, which may not be available, e.g. when 
using gas-chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID)) to align the peaks across individuals for subsequent chemometric analysis and pattern detection .The simple assumption is that peaks with similar retention times
represent the same substances. However, it is highly recommended to verify this assumption by
comparing also the mass-spectra (if available) of the substances of interest.

## Input file format

The input file for GCalignR is a .txt file, whereby all elements should be separated by tabs (with
sep = "/t") or any other separator, which has to be specified with the `sep` argument (see
`?read.table` for a list of separators) :

* The first row contains the individual IDs, whereby every ID must be unique. Optimally, IDs don't
contain whitespaces and use the underscore _ as the only special character. 

* The second row
contains the names of the data columns. For example, if you extracted both the retention time of a
peak as well as the area under the peak you would write `RT area` into the second line. 

* Starting with the third row peak data is included, whereby single samples are concatenated
horizontally. Each chromatogram needs to consist of the same number of columns, at least two are
required (e.g. the retention time and the area).

```{r, out.width = 500, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("example.jpg") 
```

Naturally, not all chromatograms contain the same number of peaks.

```{r, out.width = 500, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("example2.jpg") 
```

### alternative input from R

Alternative to reading a .txt file, GCalignR also takes input directly from R. Here, `data`
has to be a `list` of `data frames`. Each `list` element (`data frame`) has the ID of an individual
and the `data frame` itself contains the gc-peak data for this individual (again, the minimum
number of columns is one column for the retention time and one column for another variable such as the area under the peak
or it's height). All column names within `data frames` have to be the same.
The attached dataset `peak_data` contains data from skin swabs of Antarctic Fur Seals (*Arctocephalus gazella*). 

```{r} 
data("peak_data")
length(peak_data) # number of individuals 
names(peak_data) # names of individuals 
head(peak_data[[1]]) # column names and data 
```

## GCalignR workflow

### Check the input

Quickly check the data for the correct format with `check_input`. This function tests for full conformity with the requirements
of the aligning algorithm. Common error sources such as missing data or missing sample names are eliminated as well as unconsistencies 
among samples (if the input is a list of samples). Error messages will indicate any violation.

```{r}
check_input(data = peak_data,list_peaks = F) # If list_peaks = T, a histogram of peaks is plotted 
```

### Align Chromatograms

The main function in `GCalignR´s` alignment workflow is `align_chromatograms` and this is how it works. 
See `align_chromatograms` for a detailled description of the arguments.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
peak_data <- peak_data[1:4] # subset for speed reasons
peak_data_aligned <- align_chromatograms(data = peak_data, # input data
    conc_col_name = "area", # peak abundance variable
    rt_col_name = "time", # retention time 
    rt_cutoff_low = 5, # cut peaks with retention times below 5 Minutes
    rt_cutoff_high = 45, # cut peaks with retention times above 45 Minutes
    reference = NULL, # Reference will be choosen automatically 
    max_linear_shift = 0.05, # maximum linear shift of chromatograms
    max_diff_peak2mean = 0.03, # maximum distance of a peak to the mean
    min_diff_peak2peak = 0.03, # maximum distance between the mean of two peaks
    blanks = "C2", # no blanks. Specify blanks by names (e.g. c("blank1", "blank2"))
    delete_single_peak = TRUE, # delete peaks that are present in just one sample 
    write_output = NULL) # add c("time","area") to write data frames to .txt file
```
```{r}
data("aligned_peak_data") # the package includes the already aligned data set  
``` 

### Plot Diagnostics for the aligned data

To visualise the conducted alignment use `gc_heatmap` to quickly inspect the 
aligned peak profiles. By changing function arguments the heatmap can be customized according to your needs. 
A white filling indicates the absence of a peak in a sample, when using the default option of a binary heatmap.  

```{r,message=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6}
gc_heatmap(aligned_peak_data,threshold = 0.05) # By default a threshold of 0.05 is used to mark deviations
```


```{r,message=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6}
plot(aligned_peak_data) # Three Diagnostics, can be invoked separetely
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(aligned_peak_data) # Summary of the alingnment procedure
```
### Normalise peaks and log+1 transformation

`norm_peaks` is used to normalize the desired measure of concentration on the individual level in order
to compensate for differences in the baseline concentration of samples. Note that this step is required,
even if the data already contained a measure of relative abundance, in case that any of retention time cutoffs, single peak deletion or blank peak removal was applied. The output is a list of data frames containing the relative abundance of peaks for every individual.

```{r}
scent <- norm_peaks(aligned_peak_data,conc_col_name = "area",rt_col_name = "time",out = "data.frame") # normalise area and return a data frame
scent <- log(scent+1) # commonly used transformation for abundance data to reduce the extent of mean-variance trends
````


### Visualise patterns by ordination plots using the *vegan* package

`vegan` offers a variety of useful function for the analysis of multivariate abundance data such as the scent profiles handled here. Check out *?vegan* for a first overview. 

### Non-metric multidimensional scaling 
```{r,fig.align="center",fig.cap="NMDS-Plot"}
library(vegan)
data("peak_factors") # factors for individual scent samples
scent <- scent[match(row.names(peak_factors),row.names(scent)),] # bring both to the same order
scent_nmds <- vegan::metaMDS(comm = scent) # performs Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
scent_nmds <- as.data.frame(scent_nmds$points) # get the xy coordinates for every individual 
scent_nmds <- cbind(scent_nmds,colony=peak_factors$colony) # add the colony as a factor 
ggplot2::ggplot(data = scent_nmds,ggplot2::aes(MDS1,MDS2,color=colony)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point(size=4) + ggplot2::stat_ellipse(size=2) + ggplot2::labs(title ="", x = "MDS1", y = "MDS2") + ggplot2::theme_void()
```
### Multivariate analysis using *adonis*
Using **adonis** and **betadisper** we can immediately do multivariate statistics, showing that the two colonies differ significantly. This illustrates a location effect.
```{r}
vegan::adonis(scent ~ peak_factors$colony,permutations = 999) # Colonies differ in the location
anova(vegan::betadisper(vegan::vegdist(scent),peak_factors$colony)) # No dispersion effect
```
