\title{Normalisation of peaks}
\usage{
norm_peaks(GCout, conc_col_name = NULL, rt_col_name = NULL,
  out = c("list", "data.frame"), percent = TRUE, which = c("aligned",
  "raw"))
}
\arguments{
\item{GCout}{object of class GCaling created with \link{align_chromatograms}. Contains a list
of data.frames including the retention time and other variables, of which one needs
to be named as specified by \code{conc_col_name}.}

\item{conc_col_name}{character string denoting a column in data.frames of \code{GCout}
containing a variable describing the abundance of peaks (e.g. peak area or peak height).}

\item{percent}{logical, if \code{percent = TRUE} normalised conentraion scale up to 100, otherwise to 1.}

\item{which}{character string naming the data source to normalise. Either the aligned data or the raw data prior to alignment. The latter can be used for demonstration purposes.}
}
\value{
a list of data.frames containing normalised peak abundances

\description{
\code{norm_peaks} calculates the relative abundance of a peak by normalising
with regard to the cumulative abundance of all peaks that are present within an
individual chromatogram. The desired measure of peak abundance needs to be a column
within the original gas-chromatography data \code{datafile} submitted to
\link{align_chromatograms}.
