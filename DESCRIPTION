Description: Aligns chromatography peaks with a three step algorithm: (1) Linear
    transformation of retention times to maximise shared peaks among samples
    (2) Align peaks within a certain error-interval (3) Merges rows that are likely
    representing the same substance (i.e. no sample shows peaks in both rows and
    the rows have similar retention time means).
    The method was first described in Stoffel et al. (2015) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1506076112>.
