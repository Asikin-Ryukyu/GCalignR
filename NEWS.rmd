# GCalignR 1.0.0
___

## Changes since release 0.1.0

### New functions are implemented
* `choose_optimal_reference` offers an automatism to pick suitable references.
* `draw_chromatograms` allows to represent a peak list in form of chromatogram.
* `remove_blanks`allows to get rid of peaks that represent contamination after aligning a dataset
* `remove_singletons` allows to remove single peaks from the dataset after aligning
* `merge_redundant_rows` allows to merge rows that were not recognised as redundant during the alignment by increasing the threshold value for the evaluation of similarity

### Algorithm
* Using `pbapply`, we implemented progress bars to inform the user about the progress and the estimated running time of intermediate steps in the alignment of peak lists.
* By implementing more efficient code, we were able to speed up the processing, especially picking references is faster by an order of magnitude. 

#### Full alignment of peaks
* Retention times are not rounded to two decimals anymore. Calculations still capture a precision of two decimals for computational reasons.
* Within the aligned results, retention times correspond to the input values. Linear adjustments are only used internally and are documented within the Logfile accessible in the output.

#### Reference selection
* Reference samples that are used for the coarse alignment of retention times can be picked using a novel algorithm that determines the average similarity across the dataset. 

### warning messages
* Warnings addressing formatting issues are now more explicit and partly rephrased to avoid ambiguity.

### Plots 
* Added horizontal axis to barplots summarising peak numbers in `plot.GCalign`.
* Changed to more prominent colours in binary heatmaps with `gc_heatmap`.
* The function `draw_chromatograms` was added as another visualisation tool. 

### Vignette
* We included a second vignette that explains the algorithm and the supported data in detail.

### Documentation
* Helpfiles were rewritten to enhance clarity.
