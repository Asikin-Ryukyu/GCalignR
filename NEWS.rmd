# GCalignR 0.1.0.9000

___

## Changes since release 0.1.0

### Algorithm
#### Linear Shifts
* Retention times are not rounded to two decimals anymore. Calculations still capture a precision of two decimals for computational reasons and gurantee a high precision 
* Within the aligned results, retention times correspond to the input values. Linear adjustments are only used internally and are documented within the Logfile found in the output.
* By evaluating linear drift over the course of the chromatography run, peaks are thought to be homologous to the reference if the retention times matches within an allowed error proportional to parameter _max\_diff\_peak2mean_

### warning messages
* Warnings addressing formatting issues are now more explicit and partly rephrased to avoid ambiguity.

### Plots 
* Added horizontal axis to barplots summarising peak numbers in `plot.GCalign`.
* Changed to more prominent colours in binary heatmaps with `gc_heatmap`.

### Vignette
* Extended and rewritten to enhance clarity.
