# GCalignR 0.1.0.9000

___

## Changes since release 0.1.0

### New functions
* `draw_chromatograms` allows to represent a peak list in form of chromatogram.

### Algorithm
* Using `pbapply`, we implemented progress bars to inform the user about the progress and the estimated running time of intermediate steps in the alignment of peak lists.
* By implementing more efficient code, we were able to speed up the processing significantly. 

#### Linear Shifts
* Retention times are not rounded to two decimals anymore. Calculations still capture a precision of two decimals for computational reasons.
* Within the aligned results, retention times correspond to the input values. Linear adjustments are only used internally and are documented within the Logfile accessible in the output.
* By evaluating linear drift over the course of the chromatography run, peaks are thought to be homologous to the reference if the retention times matches within an allowed error proportional to parameter _max\_diff\_peak2mean_

### warning messages
* Warnings addressing formatting issues are now more explicit and partly rephrased to avoid ambiguity.

### Plots 
* Added horizontal axis to barplots summarising peak numbers in `plot.GCalign`.
* Changed to more prominent colours in binary heatmaps with `gc_heatmap`.
* The function `draw_chromatograms` was added as another visualisation tool. 

### Vignette
* We included a second vignette that explains the algorithm and the supported data in detail.

### Documentation
* Partly, function help files are rewritten and errors are corrected.
