Description: Aligns Chromatography peaks with a three step algorithm: (1) Full
    alignment of chromatograms by linear transformation of retention times to 
    maximise similarity among homologous peaks (2) Partial alignment of peaks within 
    a user-defined retention time window to cluster homologous peaks (3) Merging rows
    that are likely representing homologous substances (i.e. no sample shows peaks in 
    both rows and the rows have similar retention time means).
    The method was first applied in Stoffel et al. (2015) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1506076112>.
